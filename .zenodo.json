    "description": "<p><strong>A reproducible research software demonstrating continuous integration for numerical optimization algorithms.</strong></p><p>This repository contains a complete framework for automated testing of gradient descent optimization methods using benchmark functions with known analytical solutions (Rosenbrock and Sphere functions). The project demonstrates best practices for reproducible computational research including:</p><ul><li>Automated CI/CD testing via GitHub Actions</li><li>Verification against analytical solutions</li><li>Complete environment specification with pinned dependencies</li><li>Comprehensive documentation and tutorials</li><li>Test output archiving for reproducibility verification</li></ul><p><strong>Contents:</strong></p><ul><li>Gradient descent optimizer implementation (optimizer.py)</li><li>Benchmark test functions with analytical solutions (test_functions.py)</li><li>Automated test suite (test_minimal.py, test_optimization.py)</li><li>CI/CD workflow configuration (.github/workflows/)</li><li>Interactive HTML tutorial (CI_Tutorial.html)</li><li>Complete documentation (README.md, CI_EXPLANATION.md)</li></ul><p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> This framework is designed for researchers developing new optimization methods who need automated verification that their algorithms correctly solve benchmark problems. Each archived version represents a tested, reproducible state of the codebase suitable for citation in academic publications.</p>",
